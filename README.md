## SM Chat

This is my first university project (2010)

Expect it to have:

* bugs
* more bugs
* experimental bugs
* security holes
* useless features
* horrible source code
* and more!

It won't let you enjoy life, for sure.


### Pre-requisites:

* Apache 2 with: mod_rewrite
* PHP >=5.3
* MySQL 5


### Installation process:

1. Create a MySQL database
2. Import the chat.sql
3. Fill database config in application/config/database.php

5. In database, change a role of registered user to "3" to make him admin
